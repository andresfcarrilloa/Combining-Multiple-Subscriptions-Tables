# Combining-Multiple-Subscriptions-Tables
In this query, we're 🎨 creating a blend 🌟 of active subscriptions from two distinct products. We then take a step back in time ⏪ by dissecting these subscriptions 🔍, grouping them by year 📅, and counting how many have graced our presence each year 📈. It's all about dissecting the data's historical patterns. 📊🕰️
